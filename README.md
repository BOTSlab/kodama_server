# kodama_server
This repository is a fork of Calvin Gregory's [microUSV](https://github.com/CalvinGregory/microUSV) which is being adapted as the server to work with the Kodama robots housed in the [BOTS Lab](http://bots.cs.mun.ca).

This repository contains source code for only the server-side component **CVSensorSimulator**, which is (so far) identical to microUSV's **CVSensorSimulator**.
